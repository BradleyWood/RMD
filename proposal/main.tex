    \section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

    Systems like Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) allow developers to distribute
    workload across a network.
    However, systems like RMI require extensive setup on the server side do facilitate
    code migration but c...
    If the client wants to execute load balanced jobs across many machines
    a simple migration process could shield the developer from a client-server
    architecture and simplify the project setup.
    Java RMI also has other design limitations that prevent the client from execution static
    methods because they cannot be defined in an interface.

    \section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item To streamline distributed workloads on the JVM
        \item To provide load balancing across several machines
        \item To allow clients to donate computing resources
        \item To provide synchronous and asynchronous job requests
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}

    \subsection{Code Migration}\label{subsec:migration}

    Inorder to execute instructions a remote server, we must perform a migration action
    upon the function's first invocation.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{migration.png}
        \caption{The migration process}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Load Balancing}\label{subsec:balancing}

    The load balancer should act as a middle-man between the client and the server
    and the client should not know the difference between communication with
    the load balancer or with a job server.


    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{balancing.png}
        \caption{Interaction between entities}
    \end{figure}

    To balance a set of tasks we choose one of the following techniques:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[--] Round robin
        \item[--] Lowest CPU usage first
    \end{itemize}

    A round robin job scheduler would be the easiest scheme to implement, however
    it comes with a few pitfalls.
    For example, in a round robin system, computers with weaker performance could
    become over utilized where as powerful computers could become underutilized.
    The algorithm would also not be abel to distinguish from short or long jobs
    causing the efficiency of the computing network to be unpredictable.
    A scheduling algorithm that prioritizes job servers based on the CPU usage
    is more ideal.
    However, this system is likely to have some degree of inaccuracy due to network
    latency.

    \subsubsection{Distributed Transparency}

In some cases, the system could fail due to a variety of reasons including
    network and system failure or even a lack of servers to process the job.
    In these events, failure and recovery should be hidden from the client
    by making use of the following protocols.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{failure.png}
            \caption{No Resources Protocol}
        \end{subfigure}
        \begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{disconnect.png}
            \caption{Connection Lost Protocol}
        \end{subfigure}
    \end{figure}

    In the event that a user's job throws an exception, the server will return
    the exception information including it's detail message and stack trace.
    The client would sanitize the stack trace and then throw the exception
    in an attempt to make it look like the instructions had always been
    executing locally.

    \subsection{Use Cases}\label{subsec:useCases}


    \subsection{Proposed Usage}\label{subsec:proposageUsage}
    In theory, the system should be viable for any JVM language, and not just java.
    We plan to officially support the Java and Kotlin programming languages.
    Since the main objective of this project is to simplify the implementation
    of distributed software over a network, we have provided a few proposed
    examples to demonstrate both synchronous and asynchronous job execution.

    Regardless of the language, code that is to be executed on a remote job
    server will be denoted with a method reference or lambda expression.
    It is important to note using this technique because it allows the developer
    to maintain static type safety.

    \subsubsection{Synchronous Java Example}

    \begin{lstlisting}
        System.out.println("6! " + delegate(Function::factorial, 6));
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Asynchronous Java Example}

    In this code snippet, the main calculation is done asynchronously
    by the server and the client does not block while waiting for the reply.
    the client is then free to do other tasks while the server completes the job.

    \begin{lstlisting}
        delegate((a, b) -> a * b, 5, 9, n -> {
            System.out.println("5 * 9 = " + n); // the callback
        });
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Synchronous Kotlin Example}

    Since Kotlin has extremely expressive syntax, a function which accepts a
    lambda expression can be written as a block with a body. For example, code
    in the delegate block would be executed remotely in a blocking manor.

    \begin{lstlisting}
        val a = 100
        val b = 200

        val result = delegate {
            a * b // blocking execution on remote server
        }

        println("$a * $b = $result")
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Asynchronous Kotlin Example}

    To execute an asynchronous job, the programmer can define code within an
    'async' block and optionally provide a 'callback' block to aquire the result.

    \begin{lstlisting}
        val a = 100
        val b = 200

        async {
            a * b // execute asynchrnously on job server
        } callback {
            println("$a * $b = $it") // disply result locally
        }

    \end{lstlisting}
