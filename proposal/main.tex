    \section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}

    Systems like Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) require extensive setup on the
    server side which do not facilitate code migration.
    If the client wants to execute load balanced jobs across many machines
    the migration process can save the developer from a client-server architecture
    and simplify the project setup.
    Java RMI also has other design limitations that prevent the client from execution static
    methods because they cannot be defined in an interface.
