    \addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
    % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
    % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
    % This command does not take effect until the next page
    % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
    % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
