\section{ARCHITECTURE}\label{sec:architecture}

The distributed system is designed with a multi-tier
architecture and can be used with either 2-tier, or 3-tier
setups.

In the 3-tier architecture, the client communicates with the load balancer
which acts as a middleman between the client and job servers.
Any scheduling algorithm could be used with the load balancer via
dependency injection.
It should be noted that in the 2-tier setup, the client can still make use
of several job servers because it has its own built-in load balancer.
This approach requires the client to have prior knowledge about
the existence of each job server.
