\section{CONCLUSIONS}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have created an intuitive interface for users to efficiently perform jobs securely on remote servers. We implemented a load balancer to prevent servers from becoming overutilized or underutilized, which keeps our servers running as efficiently as possible. We also support Resource Dontation, in which a client would opt-in to receive job requests and complete them for other users. This will allow our network to become even more powerful since more jobs will be able to run concurrently. Our project makes it easier to solve parallelizable problems by providing a simple solution for defining and executing different tasks remotely.
