\section{CONCLUSIONS}\label{sec:conclusions}

We have created an intuitive interface for users to efficiently
perform jobs securely on remote servers.
We implemented a load balancer to prevent servers from becoming
overutilized or underutilized, which keeps our servers running
as efficiently as possible.
We also support resource donation, in which a client would
opt-in to receive job requests and complete them for other users.
This will allow our network
to become even more powerful since more jobs will be able
to run concurrently.
Our project makes it easier to solve
parallelizable problems by providing a simple solution for
defining and executing different tasks remotely.

If you are in need of an easy to setup cluster computing
platform, you may benefit from the usability features
provided by RMD.
However, RMD is not without limitations.
For example, it is not the tool for processing
large amounts of data.


\subsection{Future Works}\label{subsec:futureWorks}

Sometimes we wish to develop jobs that can be provided with
continuous updates between the client and server during their
execution.
In the future, this project will support communication
channels such that objects could be transferred between
client and server.
This idea is popular with concurrent systems written in
the Go programming language.
