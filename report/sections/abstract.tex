    RMD (remote method delegation) is a secure lightweight cluster computing
    platform with load balancing and code migration.
    RMD is focused on improving the usability issues that plague
    related industry solutions.
    The platform is implemented on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
    and officially supports the Java and Kotlin programming languages,
    however, the platform should theoretically work with other JVM languages.
    RMD was designed to simplify the implementation of distributed algorithms
    by providing a Kotlin DSL (domain specific language) that allows
    the programmer to define jobs within dedicated code blocks.
    Users from around the world are able to donate their own computing
    resources by hosting their own job server.
    Security concerns have been thoroughly dealt with by placing all untrusted
    code within a sandbox environment that prevents potentially malicious
    actions from taking place.
