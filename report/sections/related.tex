\section{RELATED WORK}\label{sec:related}

There are several cluster computing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Hazelcast. These frameworks facilitate the combination of several independent computers into a unified system through software and networking. This architecture allows higher availability for greater performance computing and reality to provide greater computational power than the individual machines. These existing systems however have high barriers of entry, which require a complicated
setup process that the average users could not do in order to utilize the benefits of the framework. Our project will be tackling this issue and improve upon
RPC systems by facilitating load balancing with
code migration in cluster computing applications.
Some existing RPC systems may implement code
migration, but they do not provide any load balancing
capabilities and Java RMI has design limitations
that prevent the client from executing static
methods because they cannot be defined in the interface.
The goal of this platform is to eliminate
the common barriers of entry to solving large-scale
distributed problems and to provide clients with
limited programming experience the opportunity to
parallelize large tasks over a network.
The project has increased usability over other
examples of RPC systems with code migration. It
streamlines distributed workloads on the JVM so
that the user only needs to make the request and
specify any dependencies.
